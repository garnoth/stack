# Lego Stack
 This is my first attempt and writing a TCP/IP stack from the ground up
## Getting started
 development is currently setup for a TAP device on an OpenBSD system
 other OS/s will be added later. Writing this for IPv4 but trying to do some groundwork for adding in IPv6 later

### Running
    Currently my highly complex builds script is called BA for build all
